## A web app for creatives with no friends

Sidegig is a web app created with the MEAN stack that allows creatives to post listings for help with passion projects. It allows people with a very specific skillset to search for others with complementary skillsets. 

Currently, there are four categories of gigs:
* Graphic Novels
* Web Development
* Music
* Game Development

The app is still in development.
